Our project analyzes global hunger and food security trends, focusing on the Philippines' progress toward hunger reduction. Using data-driven predictions, we examine key food security factors influencing hunger levels and assess whether current efforts are sufficient to meet global targets. By leveraging current data, we aim to determine if the Philippines is on track for the Zero Hunger 2030 goal.

The bigger picture
Hunger and food insecurity are problems faced globally - particularly third-world nations such as the Philippines. Because of this, we aim to analyze the situation of hunger levels in the country, how we compare globally, and what will be the status of hunger in the Philippines in the near future.
Agriculture is a significant contributor to the Philippine economy, making up 8.4% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP), according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). But despite this, hunger and food insecurity are one of the biggest challenges facing the Philippines today. As a country with a considerable agricultural output, the fact that as much as 44.7% of the population in the country experience moderate to severe levels of food insecurity is alarming. This poses considerable risks to the nutrition of the country, especially with children, as poor nutrition may lead to the stunting of their development.
This led us to the questions...
1.HOW DOES THE PHILIPPINES’ PROGRESS IN REDUCING HUNGER COMPARE TO GLOBAL TRENDS?
2.WHAT ARE THE KEY FOOD SECURITY FACTORS INFLUENCING HUNGER REDUCTION IN THE PHILIPPINES?
3.WHAT ARE THE PROJECTED HUNGER LEVELS IN THE PHILIPPINES BY 2030?

PROBLEM
The Philippines’s state of food insecurity compared to other countries, as well as our current level of hunger in 2024 compared to past years.
SOLUTION
Our solution is to use data science to gain insights on the state of food insecurity and hunger in the Philippines, what could be our hunger level by 2030, and from there, what we can do to address this issue.
